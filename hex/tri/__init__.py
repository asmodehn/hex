"""
Concept :
Hexagonal architecture can be implemented in various ways depending on host language.
However we should attempt to keep a structure of 6 triangles in order to make cross-checks and compatibility easier...

Given the hex architecture 3 divisions :
  __
/ _/\
\/__/

Proactor / Reactor

  __
/___\
\___/

Inside / Outside

  __
/\_ \
\__\/

Hidden /Shown

we obtain the 6 triangles by combinations :

PIH
POH
POS
ROS
RIS
RIH
